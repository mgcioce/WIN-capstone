##1) Installing Nodejs and npm

Nodejs is a javascript runtime (i.e. it interprets and executes javascript). Technically we do not need Nodejs to execute a react front end (since that occurs through the browser's javascript runtime), but we will be using npm (Node Packet Manager) to install and build our React app, which requires Nodejs to work.

###To install Nodejs and npm:

####Windows:
1) Go to https://nodejs.org/en/
2) Click on the download for LTS (long term service)
3) open the .msi file and run the installer

####macOS:
1) Go to https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2) select the macOS installer
3) run the installer

afterwords open up the command line/terminal and run the following command:

> node -v

you should see a response such as:
> v12.6.0

if not, please contact me.

####npm
After installing node, run this command:

> npm install -g npm@latest

This will install the latest version of npm on your machine. 
please contact me if you have any  issues.
